- librealsense2 installation troubleshooting
- Experienced incompatible kernel versions with the current stable release: 6.5 vs RPI's 6.8
- Tried libuvc installation: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/libuvc_installation.md
- What worked: sudo apt install ros-jazzy-librealsense2*
- Unable to find D435 device when plugged in, lsusb returned nothing
- The cable was a problem: D435 requires USB 3.0 with data & power
- rs-enumerate-devices recognized, lsusb shows D435
## Next:
- Continue building python simulation and develop algorithm
- Test streaming RPI 5 -> main laptop
