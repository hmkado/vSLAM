Checked Realsense install
Streamed video feed from RPI 5 to Laptop using Rviz2
Encountered a problem where rviz command didn't work
Fix: ros2 run rviz2 rviz2
Streaming very slow, but only needed to check install and functionality on RPI 5

# Next:
Continue building python simulation base
Identify and fix streaming rate, perhaps bandwidth issue
Purchase motor parts and test STM32 PID
